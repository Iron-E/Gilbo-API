# Gilbo: RPG & Battle API
## Capabilities
Gilbo is an object-oriented interface for games that allows creation of items, inventories, entity stat lists, attacks, and attack lists. The collection of these objects is called an "entity". Some examples of entities would be the player, enemies, NPCs, or vendors.

Gilbo also comes with basic location management using NumPy's matrix class. However, this system can be easily replaced by any other; even a 2D or 3D location system.
